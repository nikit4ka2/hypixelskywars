#                     IMPORTANT INFORMATION                 #
#-----------------------------------------------------------#

# This is used to determine what version of the config you are using.
# Please do not change this as it may cause issues with your config.
version: 20

# This will automatically move your current config to "config-old.yml" and replace with a new, updated, "config.yml".
# If you ever get tired of your config being moved, just change this to "false".
auto-update-config: true

# This is used for the Guild's Announcement System, which allow me (The Author) to communicate to you guys without updating.
# The way this works is very simple. If you have "console" set to "true", you will see the announcement when the server starts.
# If you have "in-game" set to "true", your OPed players will see it the first time they login to the server.
# OPed players will only be notified on the first time they login after each server reboot.
announcements:
  console: true
  in-game: true

#-----------------------------------------------------------#
#                     Hooks Configuration                   #
#-----------------------------------------------------------#

# Hooks will control what the plugin can hook into.
# For Guild Claims to work, you MUST have WorldGuard installed & the WorldGuard Hook enabled.
# If you change a hook to true and don't actually have the plugin, it may throw errors.
# Note on the NameTagEdit Hook: They may not all look the best if someone has a long guild name / username.
# It will allow 16 characters before the user's Username.
hooks:
  worldguard: false
  nametagedit: false

# This allows you to configure how nametags will work in game with NameTagEdit.
# You can also display a guild's prefix by using {prefix} instead of {guild}.
nametagedit:
  name: "&7[&b{guild}&7]&r "

#-----------------------------------------------------------#
#                     CHOOSE YOUR LANGUAGE                  #
#-----------------------------------------------------------#

# Choosing your language for the plugin couldn't be easier! The default language is english.
# Not an english server? No worries, you can choose from the following list of languages that we currently support.
# If you speak another language but don't see it here, feel free to submit it via one of the links above to have it added to the plugin.
# NOTE: If you change your language please ONLY use from the list above and use them EXACTLY as they are spelled in the list above.
# Example: If I am a french server, I would change lang: english to lang: french
# If you try and use a different language than any in the list above, the plugin will not function in a normal manner.
lang: vietnamese
# The plugin also supports the following other languages:
# - chinese
# - dutch
# - english
# - french
# - hungarian

#                  Guild Claims Configuration               #
#-----------------------------------------------------------#
# This section of the config will allow you to handle guild land claiming.
# Remember that the enable / disable for this is the WorldGuard Hook at the TOP of the config.
# There are multiple options when it comes to guild claims. For the time being, all guilds will only get one claim.
# As a server owner, you will have a few options here.
# First off, you will have the ability to have a standard set claim size.
# There is an option you can modify if you want players to be able to set their own claim size.
# Don't worry, you will be able to modify the max claim size to prevent abuse.
# Prices for guilds will be based up each section of blocks they claim with the region.
# For example: If I want a 25x25 claim, I'd do /guild claim 25 and I'd be charged 25 * price you set.

# Would you like to allow players to set their own claim size?
custom-claim-size: false

# You can set the max size for the claim size, so players can't take some absurd amount
custom-max-claim-size: 100

# Here you can set the custom price for claiming with custom regions (read above to see how it works)
custom-claim-price: 10.00

# Here you can set the regular max claim size when you aren't allowing custom claims

#                     Guild Upgrade Configuration           #
#-----------------------------------------------------------#

# This section of the config will talk about various parts of upgrading a guild and allow you to choose how it works.
# For "mob-xp-multiplier" the default is 1, meaning that it will drop the normal amount of XP for non-upgraded guilds.
# DO NOT set it to 0, that will either throw errors or cause mobs to not drop XP.

# You can make as many as you want. You MUST name each tier "tier1, tier2, tier3, etc." while following the format of the already made ones.
# For example: if I wanted to add a 4th tier, I would do this:

# tier4:
#   name: "Diamond"
#   cost: 400
#   max-members: 100
#   mob-xp-multiplier: 4
#   damage-multiplier: 4
#   max-bank-balance: 40000

# Keep in mind for the damage-multiplier, it applies to players also, so by default it's set to normal for every tier to allow you
# to choose how it will work.

# Change "use-bank-balance" to true to make it use Guild Banks for upgrading tiers.
